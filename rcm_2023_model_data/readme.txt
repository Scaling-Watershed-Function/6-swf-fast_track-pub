Dataset title (what):


Source Citation (where): 


Analytical purpose (why):


Important remarks:

I created two model outputs with the complete model input sets.
I also include R scripts to fill the model inputs and post-process the model outputs  at the shared folder. 

CO2 production amounts: nhd_stream_annual_resp.csv (you can use “totco2g_m2_day (aerboic+anaerobic) or totco2_o2g_m2_day (aerobic) ”, total co2 production per stream area)

O2 consumption amount: nhd_stream_annual_o2_consum.csv (you can use “tot_o2_cons_g_m2_day (aerobic)”)


 first 1000 hourly outputs : reach_snapshot_lat.h5 and each_snapshot_ver.h5
